Not all autumn Saturdays are created equal. Every year-- 2020 excluded-- four stand apart, if you are a Badger fan that it is. On these sacred days, Wisconsin eviscerates another school's football program in Camp Randall. Sometimes the victory is all but assured, other times it must be earned. This particular Saturday will start off not unlike the hundreds before, but by the the 5th quarter, will be cemented in history.
