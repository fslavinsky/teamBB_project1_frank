Not all autumn Saturdays are created equal. Every year-- 2020 excluded-- four stand apart, if you are a Badger fan that it is. On these sacred days, Wisconsin eviscerates another school's football program in Camp Randall. Sometimes the victory is all but assured, other times it must be earned. This particular Saturday will start off not unlike the hundreds before, but by the the 5th quarter, will be cemented in history. 
As the sun's rays peek over the capital square, and the air is filled with the scent of freshly baked cheese bread, badger fans awaken. Backyards are filling with fanatics and the grills are lit. As the Natty's pour smoothly and fans begin to stumble, Wisconsin is ready to pummel some Big Ten foes. As the hype song booms over the stadiums sound system and the stadium begins to shake, badger fans from far and wide being too poor into Camp Randall. (hillmer)
Come for the football, stay for the party and even walk home through a Camp Randall. When you say Wis-con-sin, you've said it all. That's part of the life of the Badger fans. What impresses people around the country is Wisconsin's ability to play good, competitive football, and make the gameday experience unforgettable. No matter if it's the mild, autumn temperatures of September or the rigid, below freezing November weather, nothing changes on a Wisconsin gameday. People are doing crazy thing here.(Zijing)
